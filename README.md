# Build Google Homepage

Project of recreating Google homepage using only HTML and CSS.

This will be my first project from The Odin Project. I am not really sure how to make it, but I'm gonna try my best. Thank you for read this. See you soon. (Sunday, March 7th 2021)
That was too hard in the beginning. Even I erased my code completely and start again. That was helpful for me because it cleaned my mind and I could code easier.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css).
